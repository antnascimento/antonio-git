# SPIK3R

> This six-legged creature doesn’t just look like a scorpion, it also acts like one. It turns sharply, snaps with it’s crushing claw, and it’s lightning tail is ready to fire at anyone or anything that gets in its way.

- Make SPIK3R move straight forward by pressing the IR Remote Control's two Up buttons at the same time
- Make SPIK3R turn right by pressing the IR Remote Control's Right Up button
- Make SPIK3R sting by pressing the IR Remote Control's Beacon button
- Make SPIK3R snap its claw by pressing the Touch Sensor (please do connect one to enable this)
